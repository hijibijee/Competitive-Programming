Finding first few digits of a very large number of form a^n or n! 
is quite hard to understand...

Let    A = a^n
    => log A = n log a 
    
  now, A = 10^(log A)
    => A = 10^(n log a)
    => A = 10^(xxx.yyy)
    => A = 10^(.yyy) * 10^xxx
    which gives us a scientific representation as x.yz * 10^n 
    thus we get the first few digits approximately.
